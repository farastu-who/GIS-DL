# Machine Learning Framework for analyzing Satellite Data & Image Classification of Transmission Lines
#### Description
This project outlines a framework for Integrating Deep Learning Models for Spatial Data Analysis with a focus on Image Classification for Power Grid Lines in Satellite Images.

## PART 1: The Framework
“Satellite images contain an incredible amount of data about the world, but the trick is how to translate the data into usable insights without having a human comb through every single image,” said co-author Esther Rolf

## PART 2: TLC (Tranmission Line Classification) - Image Classification of Transmission Lines using Satellite Data
